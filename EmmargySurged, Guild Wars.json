This was perhaps, to be expected, given their never-ending war against the aggressive Charr. Indeed, it was their unfailing vigilance, their Great Northern Wall, and the blood they shed each year to defend it that had protected not only Ascalon, but also Kryta and Orr through the ages.",
				"Then came the invasion, and with it, the Searing. ",
				"Anyone alive today will remember the day the lands of Ascalon were blasted and torn with magic fire. Whole cities and guilds were destroyed in the Searing, and the might of Ascalon was shattered. Now the Great Northern Wall lies broken, and the Charr have overrun much of the kingdom, defiling it with their unholy shrines, killing those who stand in their way.",
				"The survival of Ascalon hinges on but a single remaining corner of the fallen kingdom—the capital city of Rin. In the final years of the last Guild War, the people of Rin looked to a soldier named Adelbern, a simple man of humble origins, who rallied the people with his courage and cunning and steeled them not only against the guilds of Orr and Kryta but also against the terrors of the Charr.",
				"The sudden destruction of most of the kingdom during the Searing has taken much of the fight out of the man now known as King Adelbern. He has become stubborn and set in his ways, afraid of losing what little he has left. But in his son Rurik, the people see a leader with the courage to perhaps help them reclaim their fallen kingdom.",
				"The survivors of Ascalon live in a state of constant warfare, using hit-and-run tactics and the remnants of the Great Wall to prevent any significant advances by the Charr into their territory. King Adelbern has circled the wagons, so to speak, content to simply defend what Ascalon has left and live to fight another day. Prince Rurik, on the other hand, is far more daring than his father thinks is wise, and has even suggested that the time may be coming to launch an offensive against the Charr.",
				"Already the rumbling of the winds of change can be heard in the streets. People are frightened. They wonder what will become of them. Some even wonder aloud if Adelbern has lost what it takes to steer Ascalon back from the brink. They wish to see the prince step up and take command of the kingdom. Perhaps under his guidance, the people of Ascalon will live on to see another golden age."

For centuries, Kourna has had a military government, and its leaders have been direct descendents of Warmarshal Turai Ossa. Inspired by his example, Kournans revere loyalty, patriotism, a strong sense of duty, and dedication to military service. Not every Kournan is a soldier, but farmers laboring in the fields and crafters slaving in workshops know the value of a safe and secure province. The strength of the state depends on loyalty to its leaders. Pacified Centaur laborers add to the province’s muscle. Typical Kournan dedication drives citizens to work hard for prosperity—in fact, the entire nation relies on the province’s agriculture and handiwork. Kournan adventurers go to war secure in the knowledge that their swords are well-tempered and their armor well-made, forged as surely as the soldiers who wield them."

				"The Norn are a race of nine-foot-tall warriors who live in the northernmost Shiverpeaks. They revel in the harsh climes, leading dangerous lives among savage beasts. These mighty hunters are not organised into a single nation. Instead, those who display exceptional strength and prowess in battle establish homesteads, though they are certainly not considered 'rulers'. They often spend years at a time tracking a particularly strong or clever quarry; they never give up on a battle, a pursuit, or a friend.",
				"The Norn revere the spirits of nature—from the wolf to the snow lynx -- but the most powerful of these is the Bear Spirit, who, according to myth, blessed the Norn with the ability to change shape and 'become the bear'.",
				"A race of shape-shifting half-giants from the north, the Norn value personal strength, victory, and purifying the soul through battle. They revere the spirits of animals and call on them like shamans.",
				"The Norn are a highly independent race with a fighter-centric society, holding strength and prowess in combat above everything else. To a Norn, the greatest shame is not dying in battle, but rather not having the tale of their life, especially death, told. Due to their independence, the Norn are hardly seen in large parties with the exception of great hunts, festivities, and in the larger homesteads like Gunnar's Hold.",
				"For the Norn, in order to wed, the couple must be of equal reputation, and marriage symbolises the combining of their tales. During the wedding, someone must speak on the behalf of the two to show their worth for the other.",
				"Norn culture is highly individualistic with a focus on personal success and glory—particularly when gained from the hunt or in a battle. The norn do not fear death as they believe the bold and strong can achieve immortality, but they do fear they will be weak and end up forgotten. As a result each norn seeks to prove themselves, to build their legend through feats of individual valour and great victories. Every norn hopes their legend will be told by the skaald and celebrated at a moot with story and song. Norn usually have a great sense of personal honour, for a norn without respect from others is already forgotten. For many norn, the focus on prestige means they're willing to accept any challenge which will prove their worth. They will never give up on their battle, quarry or friends, even if it means years spent tackling a strong enemy or difficult task. Yet for other norn the pursuit of prestige translates to bragging, bullying, unwise snap decisions and an unwillingness to listen to reason.",
				"Norn are a hearty, proud people—quick to anger, but also to forgive. They are, by their nature, a race of optimists, keeping a positive outlook even though they have been driven from their homelands. A setback is seen as just another challenge to overcome. They respect those who can best them in a fight so brawling among norn is common. Drinking alcohol, often to excess, is also a large part of norn culture. Being drunk and fighting is not an uncommon combination, for example, norn alemoots feature competitions of 'skill' which require the competitors to be very drunk to compete.",
				"A norn might proudly trace their worthy ancestors through many generations and may pass a common name through a family (such as Olaf Olafson, seventh son of Olaf) but a great ancestry and family connections do not grant automatic respect to a norn. Everyone is judged not by their lineage or associated group but by what deeds they have done. There is no such thing as infamy to the norn; they are often tolerant of an individual to whom other races might treat with hostility by association."

He calls his followers fledglings, inspires artists, and also favours acts of kindness towards ravens who are viewed as his flock. In some cases Raven is believed to personally come to take the life of a norn who was about to die and guide the soul to the Mists.",
				"The norn believe that Raven sees and knows all, and requires nothing but the petitioner's promise to always seek wisdom to grant them his blessing of swiftness. He only views someone unworthy in his eyes if the person does not learn from their mistakes, and he rewards the clever, the sincere, and those who seek out new experiences such as travelling the world. Although Raven represents the facets of mind that grant beings the vision to see and the wisdom to understand, his teachings also contain a darker side which some of his wayward shamans would cruelly embrace in their quest for knowledge and power at the expense of others."

				"Wherever they originated, humans are not native to the world as they were brought there by the Six Gods. The gods themselves only predate humans by a short period of time.",

With their aid, King Doric became the first ruler of all human realms. It was he who prayed to Dwayna to stop a war in 115 BE; it was he who pleaded to the gods a year before the exodus to stop the many conflicts caused by the gift of magic being given too freely; and it is his blood that seals the bloodstones.",
				"After the creation of the bloodstones, the colonies of Ascalon and Kryta gradually split off into their own kingdoms - turning the unified human kingdom into three. During this time, open conflicts raged between the various human guilds and are now referred to as the Guild Wars. The Guild Wars were so widespread that they drew the Tyrian human kingdoms into war with each other in order to stop the battling in their own streets. It took the foreign threat of Charr to finally bring an end to the internecine conflict. The event now known as the Charr invasion ravaged the three human kingdoms, forcing them to put aside their squabbling or face destruction."

The kingdom's royal family are descendants of King Doric, however it is not known how far Doric's lineage goes into the Krytan royalty. There have been few notable members of this royalty, outside the last king, King Jadon, the only known monarch is Mad King Thorn. Those of the royal bloodline are buried in the Mausoleum, which is guarded by the undead dragon Rotscale.",
				"Kryta is home to many important landmarks, such as the Wizard's Tower and the Temple of the Ages. It is also the origin of the now-mysterious Druids, former Krytans who left into the Maguuma Jungle to the west long ago.",
				"Sometime in the distant past, several large watchtowers were built along the northern coast to defend Kryta against a threat to the north."

				"Situated on a peninsula south of Ascalon and west of the Crystal Desert, Orr was a vibrant, proud, and prosperous nation. Its citizens were the favoured of the gods, living in the shadows of Arah, the deserted city once inhabited by the likes of Melandru, Dwayna, and Balthazar. Deeply spiritual, the Orrians looked after the buildings and structures left behind when the gods left Tyria, caring for them in the hopes that one day, the divine beings who created magic and bestowed it upon the world would return.",
				"The Orrians were a peaceful people, hoping only to do their duty toward their gods and content to be rewarded in either this life or the next. When the guilds began feuding, Orr as a nation tried to stay out of the conflict. This was not the sort of struggle that entire kingdoms got involved in. But when the strife overflowed into armed conflict, and guilds from the other human nations began fighting in the streets of Arah, Orr rose to defend itself and the city of the gods.",
				"Soon after Orr mobilised its armies, Kryta and Ascalon did as well, and what had started as a dispute between localised groups became an all-out war. The Guild Wars raged for nearly fifty years. During that time, none of the three human empires was able to assert dominance over either of the other two. While Ascalon, Orr, and Kryta were busy fighting with each other, they became blind to the threat from the north—the Charr.",
				"The Kingdom of Orr was the first human kingdom established on the continent of Tyria, created by both god and man. From 100 BE, the kingdom was ruled alongside Ascalon by King Doric until his death in 1BE. Orr gained its independence in the year 2 AE. At the time of the Second Great Corsair War and King Zoran's reign, Orrian territory is known to have extended into the Tarnished Coast, and included the caverns now known as the Shards of Orr. Orr was once the most vibrant, proud, and prosperous human nation in the known world. Its citizens believed themselves to be the favoured of the Six Human Gods, living in the shadows of Arah which was once inhabited by the gods themselves. Orr was known as the nexus of arcane activity and research."

				"The northern province of Vabbi is known for its great wealth and refined culture. Merchant princes pride themselves on their large estates, prosperous businesses, and patronage of the arts. Its provincial government, the Grand Forum of Vabb, is a plutocracy: only the wealthiest princes in the land have the power to make laws. Their legislature is openly democratic, but secretly, a merchant with influence has more power than a counsellor with one vote.",
				"Vabbian princes rule the land. Most plutocrats sponsor great festivals and celebrations to display their importance and influence. Celebrations in Vabbian estates are wonders to behold: Dancers flourish in their elegant fashions, gourmands sample cuisine, revellers consume epic quantities of alcohol, and cultured citizens enjoy great works of drama and poetry. Heroes are welcomed at these festivals, where their heroism is celebrated in songs and stories.",
				"The Vabbi are effusive in displays of self-importance, but also keenly aware of how much they depend on other Elonians. The guards of Vabbian estates watch the mountain range to the north, while citizens on the province's southern border depend on neighbouring Kournans to keep them safe. Outside the walls of the grand estates, danger is everywhere. Raiders know secret passes through the mountains and mines, and monstrous creatures roam the landscape. Fortunately, every generation of Vabbi includes idealists who dream of adventurous journeys across Elona. New tales of adventure appear on the shelves of Vabbi's libraries each year, as actors portray new heroes on the stages of Vabbian theatres."

Long after the Forgotten stopped threatening the Charr, the Humans appeared and, with the help of their Gods, pushed the Charr from their southern borders, conquering the land that became known as Ascalon in 100 BE. Along with being pushed back, the Khan-Ur was assassinated, preventing any hope the Charr had to retake their lands. The death of the Khan-Ur caused a schism among his four children, who became known as imperators, and brought the establishment of the High Legions - the Ash Legion, the Blood Legion, the Flame Legion, and the Iron Legion.",
				"In order to combat the Humans, they sought gods to call their own, and at the volcano called Hrangmer, the Burnt Warband discovered gods for the Charr. Having found gods, the Shaman caste, the first Charr to unite under the new fiery gods, united the rest of the Charr warbands under their faith. Though one Charr, Bathea Havocbringer, rejected these new gods. She was quickly executed as a living sacrifice to the gods and the Shaman caste banned all female Charr from warbands and armies, sent to do utility work."

To that end, the Charr have constructed a series of sacred buildings known as Flame Temples. On raised platforms, these bestial creatures have inscribed huge circular runes, which define and magically feed the sacred fires. Further defining the ring are pillars of pure obsidian or carved sandstone, sculpted to depict the faces of the mysterious creatures the Charr worship. Between these pillars, in the very centre of each of these temples, are the ever-burning Sacred Flames. The Charr believe that as long as the flames are burning, the gods are pleased. If the flames go out, then the Charr have failed in their duties and will be punished by the gods.",
				"Each temple has its own fire, which is tended at all times by four Charr Flame Keepers. The Flame Keepers have only one job—to keep the Sacred Flame burning. This is the most prestigious position a Charr can occupy; only the strongest, most capable Charr can take this honour, and all other Charr bow to the Flame Keepers.",
				"In addition to the temples, whenever a large Charr warband travels anywhere, they take with them a bronze brazier, lit at a Flame Temple by the Sacred Flame. These braziers are placed upon palanquins, which are then carried from location to location by four Charr Flame Carriers. Each night when they make camp, the Flame Carriers erect a flammable effigy in the shape of one of their gods, then ignite it and let it burn till daylight."
